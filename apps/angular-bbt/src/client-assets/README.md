# Folder Purpose

This folder is designed for configuration specific assets. Each folder in it
should be added to the assets folder in the built project overriding the
default assets with the same name.

This folder should not be used for client specific code that will be compiled
(css, scss, or less), which is has been in the past. Code here will not be
swapped in for compilation, regardless of what Mike Pugina might tell you.
